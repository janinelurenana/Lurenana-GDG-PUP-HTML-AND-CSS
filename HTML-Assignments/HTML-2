    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Janine! I am currently a BSIT student passionate about technology and web development.
    I am 17 years old and a freshman at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines. </p>
    
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy coding, gaming, chess, drawing, reading and... I have too many
    hobbies, I guess? But yeah, coding and chess challenges my critical thinking skills, 
    while gaming and reading are my escape. I love reading about crime fiction, true crime, 
    and criminal psychology - I just love diving into the complexities of the human mind.</p>
    
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>My goal is to become a skilled software developer and ethical hacker. I am always eager to expand my knowledge in these fields.</p>
